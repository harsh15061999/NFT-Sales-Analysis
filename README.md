# Python Project: NFT Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves data wrangling and analyzing NFT sales data available on Kaggle. The objective is to clean and preprocess the data, perform exploratory data analysis, and derive meaningful conclusions using Python.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** 
  - Handled missing values and outliers.
  - Converted data types and formatted dates.
  - Filtered and aggregated data for analysis.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Analyzed the distribution of NFT sales over time.
  - Identified top-performing NFTs based on sales volume and revenue.
  - Examined the relationship between NFT characteristics and sales performance.

- **Visualizations:**
  - Created insightful visualizations using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
  - Illustrated trends and patterns in NFT sales data.

- **Conclusions:**
  - Derived key insights and conclusions from the data analysis.
  - Provided recommendations based on the findings.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python:** For data wrangling, analysis, and visualization.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and aggregation.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** For creating visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive data analysis and visualization.

## How to Use
1. **Download the Project Files:** Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed (listed in requirements.txt).
3. **Run the Notebook:** Open the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file) and run the cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to use Python to wrangle and analyze NFT sales data. It showcases my ability to clean and preprocess data, perform exploratory data analysis, and derive actionable insights through visualizations.
